# BackgroudYoutubePlayer

A python program to play youtube videos in the backgroud. With bandwith limitation, videos play at the 144p thus consuming the least amount of data possible. Also a bat file enables us to run this program from the run window itself. 

To use :- 
1. Edit the 'path' environment variable, adding a path to the folder you keep these files in.
2. Open run window and type in 'w' + the name of the song or video (keep this such that the first result is the video you want to play).
    use double quotes to pass arguments of multile words.
